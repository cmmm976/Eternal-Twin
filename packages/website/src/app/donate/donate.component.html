    Eternal-Twin is a free website. We only depend on donations to cover our costs and stay online.
    The website is maintained by volunteers and we do not generate any profit.
    Eternal-Twin wants to archive the Motion-Twin games and provide a place for their communities.
    If you like what we do and want to help us, consider making a donation.

    We decided to use the <a href="https://opencollective.com/eternal-twin">OpenCollective</a> platform
    to transparently manage our donations and costs. Eternal-Twin applied for approval and we are waiting to pass the
    manual review from OpenCollective to prove that we are a legitimate project before we can accept donations.
    Once we are verified, we will be able to accept donations.
