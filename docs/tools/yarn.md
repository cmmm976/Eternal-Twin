[Official website](https://yarnpkg.com/) | [GitHub](https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry)

**Yarn** is a modern package manager for **[Node.js](./node.md)** and the web.
Compared to other such package managers (e.g. `npm`), it is faster, more
reliable, and more flexible.

## Installation

1. Install [Node.js](./node.md)
2. Run `npm install --global yarn`
3. Check your installation with `yarn --version`.
