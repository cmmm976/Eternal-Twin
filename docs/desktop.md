The application is still in an alpha state: please help us to improve it.

In particular, we need to complete [the homepage](https://gitlab.com/eternal-twin/etwin-app/-/blob/master/src/main/index.html) to have
links for all the games.
We also need to complete [the list of websites where Flash is allowed](https://gitlab.com/eternal-twin/etwin-app/-/blob/master/src/main/mms.cfg).
